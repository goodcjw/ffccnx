-- Port from internal module to a portable plugin release

-- Clean up memory

-- It seems one thread (maybe the nsNDNTransportService) is still running after
   page loading. Need to clean that. However, if run the firefox program with
   LOG module loaded up, this bug does not show up at all. All threads are released
   as they should.
