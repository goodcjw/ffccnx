## BUILD ##

### Build official version of Firefox

Make sure that you can build Firefox out of box. The following links might
be useful:

* Build documentation for Mozilla

https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Build_Documentation
Inside this document, you might want to look into the build prerequisities
according to the system your are working on.

* Simple Firefox build tutorial

### Install the CCNx browser patch

* Get the source code for ffccnx

Merge the git repository into the current Firefox code base:

    cd mozilla_central
    git clone --no-checkout git://github.com/goodcjw/ffccnx.git
    mv ffccnx/.git .
    rm -rf ffccnx
    git reset --hard HEAD

NOTE: mozilla_central is the home directory of your Firefox repository

* Apply patches

Run the following shell script to apply all CCNx patch automatically

    ./applyccnx.sh

* Library denpendency

Liking against libccn.a and libcrypto.a

    cd obj-fx-dbg/dist/lib
    ln -s /usr/local/lib/libccn.a libccn.a
    ln -s /usr/lib/libcrypto.a libcrypto.a

NOTE: 
`obj-fx-dbg` is your Firefox building output directory you set in
`.mozconfig`.
The actual location of your `libccn.a` and `libcrypto.a` file may vary in
different systems.

## USAGE ##

## TROUBLESHOOTING ##

* Got some error related to 'moz_free' in some Linux distribution

The problem might come from the crashreport. A simple walkaround is to disable
crashreport. Add a line `ac_add_options --disable-crashreporter` into the
`.mozconfig` file.

* Got some error related to -fPIC while linking against libcrypto.a

It is probably that the libcrypto.a file you are using was not compiled
with `-fPIC` option. Download openssl source code from `www.openssl.org` and
configure, make and install it with

    ./config --prefix=/usr --shared -fPIC
    make
    sudo make install

You may need to recompile `libccn.a` afterwords to make sure that it's static
link towards `libcrypto.a` is consistent with the new one.
